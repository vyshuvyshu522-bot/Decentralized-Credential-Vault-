# Decentralized-Credential-Vault-
A decentralized identity system where users generate their own DID, upload documents to IPFS, and receive a Verifiable Credential (VC) linking their DID and file CID. The VC proves authenticity and can be verified without a central authority, giving users secure, private, and full control of their digital documents.
